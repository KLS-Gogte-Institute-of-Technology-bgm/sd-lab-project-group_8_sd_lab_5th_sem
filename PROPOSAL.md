# Proposal 

## Library Management System

A library management system keeps track of the books present in the
library. It is an important piece of software which is a must at schools
and colleges. We will build a library management system using Tkinter to
make it interactive. It is a software that uses to maintain the record
of the library. It contains work like the number of available books in
the library, the number of books issued or returning or renewing a book
or late fine charge record, etc.<br>

### Overview
This project is an interactive GUI based system. It deals with reducing
the manual interruption in the library management system. We have used
python Tkinter to build a GUI application which acts as the front end.
MySQL is the backend tool for data processing and updating which acts as
the backend. The code has 7 modules related to the various different
tasks involved in library management system.<br>

### Intuition

This project describes all the relevant tasks of the library system such
as adding a book, deleting a book etc. It has an attractive front-end
GUI and a database for handling of data related to user, books issued
and books. The project does the adding of books with their statuses to
the system. It has a separate module for issuing a book to the student.
Also, has return book button for returning the book. It consists of
delete book and view book as well for deleting the books if necessary
and the list of books in the library.<br>
